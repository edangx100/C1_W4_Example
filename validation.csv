__label__-1 "this romper fit like a dream ! it is gorgeous unique and sexy . i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on ! there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top . nobody 's got time for that ! ! ! ! i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend 's 40th birthday party . but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off . no thank you ! i considered buying the romp"
__label__1 "i loved this dress the moment i first saw it ! i have another dress from this brand that i 've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail . however after trying this dress in both a size medium ( my typical size ) and a small i 've given up . it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b there is room in the chest even in the size small . so would look really good on a curvy girl ! i 'm 5 ' 5 ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited when i ordered this i love comfy clothing this looked perfect ! when i received it there was a weird smell with the top . convinced that this could be from storage or something i washed it . the smell did not go away . i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear ! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it not able to return it . the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell . now i am 'stuck ' ! !"
__label__1 "love these pants . they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together . i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me . i am usually a 4 but bought a 6. i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops . i do wish they came in more colors ."
__label__-1 "this sweater was just okay . i am happy to pay $ 100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy and not the quality i expected for that price . i may have kept it if it were at about half the price but it just was not worth it . retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less . i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer . looked great in the photos but unfortunately in person were not quality garments ."
__label__1 "this is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful . it flares out a little but not too much . order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist - or if you have broad shoulders the larger of your typical size range . i 'm typically a 00p or a 0p with a 00p hip measurement a middle range ( 00p is 24 0p is 25 ) waist measument ( 24.5 ) and a 00p bust measurement but my shoulders are broad and athletic . 0p the larger"
__label__0 "this dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on . it is on the large size but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look . longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5 ' 9 . i am sending it back . it is a pretty fabric although shinier than expected . i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it ."
__label__-1 "beautiful color design and fit . but i could n't wait to get it off . i do n't have sensitive skin and do n't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool ."
__label__1 "the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design . it looks very elegant and romantic . you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps . it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering . the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath . overall very pretty and i would highly recommend . ( i purchased the white and yellow version . )"
__label__-1 "this sweater is thick and does cover the bra well . i did not find it to be well made . the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places . i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay . putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach . for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering ."
__label__-1 "purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail -- ( i do n't know why most designers overlook the back ? ? ) . huge disappointment -- the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back is n't even the same material as the front . it 's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment . it was a very sad return ! i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess ."

__label__0 "after eyeing this product online for awhile i was able to try it on in store . i 'm so glad i did because while this dress is lovely it is clearly not designed for my body type . i have a small rib cage and a large bust ( 32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me . additionally the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible . the fabric was gorgeous and soft and the"

__label__0 "this dress had so much promise from the picture . i loved the midi length color and fascinating waist detail . i ordered online so there was no way to try on before purchasing . the fit was disappointing . it fell in an unflattering manner at every point ; a tad too low at the waist ; a tad too long at the shin . just kind of saggy all around . bummed but this is not to say it would n't fit someone with a different body shape better . the quality of fabric is nice and the color is lovely ."

__label__0 "i love this sweater so why a lower rating ? while i love the material and the color it lost all of its shape before i even left the house ! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party . i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it ."
__label__1 "this poncho is lovely . i found it fits perfectly . im 5 ' 4 125 and got the xs/s .. just long enough ( loke jacket length ) and the hood doesnt add extra weight ( doesnt drag it down the back ) . arm holes are approriate size . very cool piece for any weather layering ."
__label__0 "this sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy . the fit is larger around the arms and chest which might work well for people who are very curvy on top . it seems to taper a bit to the waist . the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape . it was too overwhelming on my petite frame what with the bold flower and the fit so i passed . but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater this could work well for you ."
__label__-1 "while the print is cute the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller . the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model ( it rides up under your boobs ) and the whole cup area tips forward - it 's not really molded like a bra more flat foam insert . immediately went back . hopefully if retailer continues to do swimwear they 'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they 're also workable for fuller cup sizes ( underwire please ! )"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress so badly . it came and the material is beautiful but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly . there was just no way to make it look good . maybe i needed a smaller size but oh well ."
__label__1 "love this jacket ! got my usual size medium and is perfect ! beautiful quality"
__label__0 "this top runs large . i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small . the medium was a little loose in the bust but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist . my figure was lost in the fabric . the small was too small for me in the bust although the waist looked more flattering . the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer ."
__label__0 "i was excited to receive this top because i love the design but was very disappointed when it arrived . i thought the embroidery would be striking but it 's not . the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment . it was not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "i thought this was so cute online sweet and feminine but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for . it is also very high waisted even for my little 5 ' 1 frame . i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone 's closet dusted it off and said ta da ! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing : )"
__label__-1 "loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size . boy do i regret that ! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit ... not attractive . wish i could return them but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand ! ! if in between sizes definitely size down ."
__label__0 "i loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store . i liked the fabric but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips ( and i do n't have big hips ) . i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts . they went back ."
__label__1 "i 'm trying to buy more basic versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that . definitely runs large -- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p . i 'm 5 ' 5 and the petite falls where it does on the model . the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like . quality seems ok for the sale price ."
__label__0 "i also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide . it was not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "well this top just did not do anything for me - it 's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit . you 'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through . i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event but it was too buttoned-up for my style . i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me . i did n't care for the feel of the fabric either although the lace is nice ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it just did n't fit in anyway . i ordered an xs petite and it was very large . the lacing in the back is completely useless and that 's what i liked about the dress . i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top ( because of chest ) and then lace more tightly near the waist . it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering . beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit ."
__label__0 "i like the design and the color of the cardigan ( i got green ) . i like the details on the back . the cardigan is tts the shoulder width and sleeves length seems perfect ( for reference : 5 ' 7 125 lb got size s ) . the problem for me is that the cardigan is not as long as it looks in the photos for the rose color ; the pictures for the beige show the length more accurately . it may work for a smaller lady but i like my cardigans a bit longer and cozier . also it is not just that the material is"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress ! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments . i have also worn it over leggings and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals . even though the material is somewhat thin i did not have to wear a cami with it . the fabric pattern is really cute !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this online and took it back the day i got it . i could not fit the neck hole over my head therefore i could n't even see how it truly fit . i had high hopes for this dress ."
__label__1 "love my jeans fit great and very flattering . they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit . receive compliments every time i wear them . if they go on sale i will buy another . : )"
__label__1 "while the blue color pictured is stunning i purchased the white poplin in store . two best features ? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small v ( a great detail especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months ) . next this white fabric 's crisp finish is coupled with a just right weight ( solid enough to be opaque but light enough for warm days ) . plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer . thrilled !"
__label__0 "this sweater is ok. i love love love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect . i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring but once it arrived i knew i had to return . the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection . i like my sweaters more flowy . if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once . also it 's a bit itchy for me-but i 'm rather sensitive and if i 'd loved this on"
__label__0 "i bought three of these tees . i kept the turquoise one only though . the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad . i love the style . the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy . the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic ( like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me ) now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab . i normally look better in more vibrant colors . the red i bought made me look like a corpse . it 's not pretty at all . ca n't re"

__label__0 "i ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top . also the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring . it had to go back but others may love it ( i have dark hair/olive skin ) . it also ran a small on top ( i 'm 38 d ) . there should be a pm available soon lol"
__label__1 "this top is very comfortable and really cute on . the material is super soft . i bought the white and am very happy with it but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it . i would definitely recommend !"
__label__1 "these are super soft and relaxed . i have them in navy and lavender . i am 5 ' 6 and 130 lbs . and ordered them in a 28 which fits loosely but comfortably ."
__label__0 "i ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl . it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear . it also attracted so much lint . the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it . it added weight and was unflattering for my shape . the colors do match the photos online . the length also matches the model 's photos . it just did n't work for me ."
__label__0 "i feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee . it 's a lovely pattern and i like the fit ( it 's not clingy ) but it 's a bit see-though . it 's not as bad as the other tee but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt ( unless that 's your thing ) . that said i 'm happy with it because it 's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather . i am very glad i got it on sale though . i would n't have paid full price for it ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress it looks beautiful on the model but it is n't the flattering even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it it it runs pretty big ."
__label__0 "this shirt is not awful but not anything pretty . there 's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist ! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in . so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways . it 's one of those i 'm too lazy to send it back it 's not that awful"
__label__-1 "bought this cami/tank on sale which i 'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted .. it kinda just drapes under the cami ... the problem is it 's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ... but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest .. so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment ... it simply looks awkward ... not sure if it would 've been better"
__label__1 "i saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design . however when i tried it on i personally found a few things that just did n't work for me : ____________ pros : - blue lace is lovely throughout nicely done . - there 's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups . i can only assume it 's to make it easier to get the dress on . it 's a nice little detail although not sure if really"
__label__-1 "looks like a pregnancy top . a lot gathers in front and back . added 10 pounds to me . not flattering on much longer than on the model . and the color is not white . it 's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe . i returned it same day i received it which was disappointing ."
__label__0 "i bought this mostly to wear around the house so i 'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale . that said this runs really large . the sleeves are really loose and it does n't really hang well over my hips which is a shame . it 's very soft and cozy which is nice but i do n't think i 'll leave the house in it often . it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel . i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling bu"

__label__0 "i received these pants but they are not as pictured see the photo of the back pockets there is a detail there that was not on the pants that i received . i 'm not sure about these the quality is nice but they are much baggier than shown and i ordered 2 sizes down ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful . however each attached to one another by single threads . given that i wear lots of rings i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers . additionally the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on . overall if you are very careful this is an amazing dress but i did return it because of its delicate nature ."
__label__1 "love this dress so much ! i bought the cranberry color first and i loved it so much that i also bought it in black . i think it runs fairly true to size . i am 5 ' 3 and about 110 and the xs petite fit perfectly . i tried the xs and it was pretty large on my frame . i love the fabric and flow of this dress and i love the pockets ."

__label__1 "this top is so soft and comfortable . i bought it on sale so would i have paid $ 60 for it . . . . not sure . fits true to size what can i say its a simple top well made and so soft ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in the mauve and it 's a really pretty lilac color . unfortunately the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it . my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area but goes downhill from there . the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front . based on the model picture i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front . it 's also very long . completely covers my butt in the back and then some . could of been a beautiful tank"
__label__0 "i 'll start by saying that i loved this dress . i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it . the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft . i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did . i 'm 5 ' 1 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great . the first time i pulled it out at home i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side the zipper seam split . i tried for a half hour to get it to realign . i finally decided to go exchange it for"

__label__-1 "this skirt is beautiful . fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it . there is a life in this skirt ; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way . or i better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it . unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape . now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore ."
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"
__label__1 "my mother who is not a dress person ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills . we 'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress and she 'd returned three other options ( different stores ) . after admiring this dress for awhile she decided to try it and is so happy she did ! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images but that 's what she was hoping for . it fits wonderfully and looks extremely elegant ."
__label__0 "unfortunately this dress ran very large on me ( please no more vanity sizing ! ) and minimized what few curves i have . my store did n't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist . it also flares out quite a bit you can see this in the catalog shot . while this was n't flattering on me it may work better on curvier figures ."
__label__1 "great very flattering bohemian dress ! and it 's silk !"
__label__-1 "i initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model . it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant . then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders . i 'm regularly a size 2/xs 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me ."

__label__0 "i love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic ; however the pockets ruin it if that 's possible . they make the dress bulky around the hips . i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium . i think this brand runs a little small . the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size . the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear . i love the subtle texture . one odd thing the tag is attached to the stand-up collar . i had my hair up when i tried"

__label__-1 "could n't make it work even belted . ivory color is darker irl -- dingy light tan like dirty vintage . drop waist is not dropped at all just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up ( below bust ) then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level ( not low hip ) into the skirt . i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy curvy waist but this does not -- adds ten pounds . poly fabric heavy/hot ; rayon lining awkward and does n't flow/drape .

__label__1 "this is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy . i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra ca n't be seen underneath with it great if you do n't feel like wearing multiple layers ."

__label__-1 "i loved the style so i ordered on line . it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear . i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit . i am returning this item .."
__label__1 "i love these shorts . i do n't understand why they are n't sold out yet ! they are buttery soft and fit great . i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size . they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even . love ! !"
__label__1 "i love this shirt . the colors are just as depicted . the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering . fits true to size for retailer small ( i 'm normally a medium outside of this store ) ."
__label__1 "this top is gorgeous in person ! i 'm in love with it ! it 's perfect for the holiday season . it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit ."
__label__-1 "i was so sad not to love this dress . it is beautiful but is so unflattering on . there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking . so it just made me look incredibly frumpy . i do n't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang the dress sort of clumps . i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem but i was super disappointed . narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off . it is a t"
__label__-1 "so sad becuase i like the design . i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment . i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight . i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt . the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on . the arms are so tight ! i ordered in a m which is my normal retailer size but could n't move my arms . took it back was going to try in a l but store did n't have any . for the price i need to be able to move my arms !"
__label__-1 "colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that 's where it ends . cheap flimsy polyester and no lining . far too expensive for what it is . on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great . i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders ) not big enough to downsize . too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress ."
__label__0 "it 's a beautiful top but not for the price . very thin material ( not see-through though ) i fear it may easily rip ."
__label__0 "such a cute dress but it runs large . i 'm 5 ' 4 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes . i tried on the xs and it was still too big . i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out . really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer . if they get more xxs i 'll buy it ."
__label__0 "i purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design . however i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit . on the model it looks nice but it was large around the torso yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit . i shall be returning it ."
__label__0 "i ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured . the length hit several inches above the knee . the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured . i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well . i tried both the small and xsmall which are my usual sizes . the small was very loose through the torso the xsmall was better but looked overall too short as if it were a petite cut . i am 5 ' 9 however the model is supposed to be 5'10 ."
__label__-1 "really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front bottom ... backside was perfect coverage ... also most important this top is see-through ! item as pictured is not accurate !"
__label__-1 "this shirt is thin and shapeless . the quality is h & m esque . unflattering . not a fan"
__label__-1 "it was very pretty but it ran very big sadly i had to return it ."
__label__1 "wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn . the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad . bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater !"
__label__-1 "was super excited to try this on but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well . just a very strange cut and unflattering . such a bummer because it 's so pretty ."
__label__1 "this is a very well made top i like the cut and it fits true to size . very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique . i 'm happy with this purchase ."
__label__-1 "the top i received was large really long in length pockets in the front along the seam and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape . the id # 's matched but that 's about it . returned !"
__label__0 "the double seams down the front of this elongate ; the material is light and would work spring through summer kind shape . even though the dress hits below the knee the buttons end mid thigh and make it cute rather than matronly . here 's the but : the rib cage area is very fitted . i 'm a 6-8 in pretty good shape and that is not a problem area for me . however in this dress it was . there was no way for my figure to pull it off . from behind in both 6 and 8 every bundle of skin seemed ample . i"
__label__0 "this top is very light and soft for summer . even the lace is soft . it 's not sheer and does n't require layering . true to size . i 'm 5 ' 4 34dd 150 lbs- m fits well . my arms are not tiny and yet the lace were n't tight for me . but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer . it 's good if you are paying the sale price ."
__label__1 "i had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it 'd work out based on all of the good reviews . when i got it i was happy with the fit and fabric but i was stumped as to what i 'd wear it with . it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just did n't know if i could pull off the length . i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath . it 's so stretchy warm and cozy ! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k"
__label__0 "just a warning the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath . i 'm not a sparkle kinda gal so as soon as i saw that the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store . i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures to me it cheapens the whole dress which would otherwise be adorable ."
__label__-1 "the sweater was nice but not as long as on the model . it was itchy also . this sweater was not what i had expected . their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash sorry retailer . i sent it back ."
__label__0 "fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top . returned"
__label__0 "it really is such a cute romper . took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable . that is in till i washed it . i 'm in europe so there are n't dryers ... washed it in cold water line-dried it and it shrunk . significantly . it still fits but the top does n't blouse over like it previously did . and the shorts feel really short . so disappointed . my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water"
__label__-1 "fabric is not as rich as shown in photo . dress much shorter than shown in photo . shoulder area is tight and really does n't blend with the material below . this is n't going to work on very many people - pear shape ... just not what i 've come to expect from retailer ."
__label__-1 "i bought two one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it . then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag ( in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry ) . it shrunk up 4 in the length and 2 in the width and now it does n't fit at all . also after one wear the buttons are coming off ( before i even put it in the wash ) and it 's covered in loose threads . the quality is just not there . i 'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"
__label__1 "it was hard for me to rate how this was sized-it is tight through the bust very baggy and boxy through the body and short . looked gorgeous on the hanger though !"
__label__0 "very pretty top . however you absolutely need to try it on before ordering . fit well in the chest area but way too big in the sides - i looked pregnant . had to return ."
__label__-1 "the color is completely off ! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture ! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment . it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture . very pale . horrible ."
__label__-1 "very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain not as displayed ."
__label__0 "i loved the fit color and style but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap . i was worried that it would tear easily . this is getting returned ."
__label__-1 "as soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging i feel in love with them . the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on ... yeah that was not going to happen ! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit ! these pants run incredibly small . i ordered them twice : once in my regular size and again in a larger size . unfortunately i am sized out of these beauties ."
__label__0 "i am very into the lace tops ! purchased this but it 's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5 ' 3 it feels almost like a tunic . lots of extra material in the back . love the look and if you 're tall enough it should work for you !"
__label__1 "these jeans ! i tried these on in addition to the high rise paige denim and these won out hands down . classic flattering fit from mother with an element of edginess with the frayed hem . these are long enough on me ( i 'm 5 ' 5 ' ) to cuff at the ankle if i do n't want a distressed look on a particular day . they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down . i have muscular calves and thighs but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a"
__label__-1 "i am so sad i have to return these leggings . they 're adorable -- so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them -- but as other reviewers have pointed out there 's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they 'll fall down ! why sleeping on snow ? whyyyyyyyyyyy ? they 're so great otherwise !"
__label__0 "the sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much . but it 's a cute pattern and style . very comfortable ."
__label__0 "the fabric was a beautiful color but the material and seams were not well put together . the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well . i unfortunately ended up returning ."
__label__0 "loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front . the slip was also slightly tight over hips . i wish this was longer !"
__label__0 "i love the style and the look of this sweater . i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much . the style looks so comfortable and easy going but it was not it was clingy around the waist and backside . for reference i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me not cool long like some other sweaters this season ."
__label__0 "i love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment . i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large . the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline would n't sit right . overall the fit was boxy and unflattering . the fabric is pretty but the style is well .... boring . there was just no wow factor for me . i think the fabric deserved a much better design . imho i think this top might be better suited fo"
__label__0 "i purchased this top in white and lavender . the white is very nice soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru ( fine with a nude bra ) . it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front but i expected that . i purchased a medium and it 's plenty roomy . i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit . the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven . it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional b"
__label__-1 "this is not a kimono . it 's a cocoon . there 's a huge difference . it 's also not made very well ."
__label__1 "i was so excited to see these pants on sale . they fit beautifully and drape well . the hidden lining of 'shorts ' is a great feature and i will get 3 seasons of use from these . now if i could only get them in plain black too ...."
__label__-1 "i love sundry and their fun designs -- i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey . it is just not what i expected from the picture . i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body ."
__label__0 "they are beautiful in person until you put the on . the fit was a bit weird ; tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch . the fabrics work 100 % against one another . the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff . the back is thin and has far too much elasticity . at $ 150 i passed . these will only enter my closet on sale ."
__label__1 "i purchased this dress on a whim . it is easy to wear and very comfortable . the empire waist is flattering . however the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line . the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress . i am happy to have it in my wardrobe . a go-to piece for years to come ."
__label__1 "some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side but for me it was big too bad the smaller size is sold out ( well all peittes are sold out ) . the length is also pretty long below the knee but in the narrow part still ... so able to keep it . the colors are great . i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists adn they all loved it and told me to keep it ... winner for sure !"
__label__0 "this runs really big . i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out . i do n't have a store close by ( about an hour away ) and i hate paying shipping for returns ! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone . i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though !"
__label__1 "in the quest to find comfy cute casual tops i took a change on this one . it 's cute but quite oversized . it just overwhelmed me . i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model . the style and color just did n't suit my coloring or body type but i still recommend because it 's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else 's closet ."
__label__1 "i originally bought these jeans in my true size . after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again . retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean ! they are a little tight for the first 5 mins and then they are perfect fit wear after wear . and so soft !"
__label__0 "while i wanted to love this dress i did not like the scratchy lining . i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress ; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably . i wish this had been done in silk would have been a much nicer material . i returned it ."
__label__1 "lightweight and cute . these pants do run on the larger side which is fine is you like a more relaxed look . i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better . great for summer weather !"
__label__0 "this jacket looks great and is well made . the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight ."
__label__-1 "this dress makes me so sad ... the textured stretchy fabric color length and overall swingy fit are spot on . as another reviewer noted though the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress . the neck is tiny which i could have gotten over once it was on but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around ( too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut ) . basically you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes . it could have been so good but alas but t"
__label__0 "this dress is n't as fitted as it looks on the model . it appear to be more of a shift dress . as gorgeous as the print and quality are it does n't look great on me . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 105lbs and bought xs . for whatever reason the high neckline is n't flattering on me . i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders ."
__label__-1 "i could n't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd . the arms cut off short and the seams do n't hit your shoulders where they should . all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering . moving around in it was not easy . i will return this one !"
__label__1 "loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past !"
__label__0 "the dress immediately caught my eye in the store . upon trying it on i discovered that the slip runs extremely small ( and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift ) . the skirt is a tad long -- i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits mid-knee . it 's a shame the slip was so tight -- i loved the dress otherwise ."
__label__-1 "do n't get me wrong this is probably cute on someone else but not me . i looked in the mirror and just laughed it was that bad . so if you 're considering getting this size down . ordered mine in large and it looks like i 'm wearing a barrel . the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape . the fabric is soft . i 'm just over trying peplums ."
__label__-1 "why do designers keep making crop tops ? ? ! ! i ca n't imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top . i looked like a football player . the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4 ' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work ? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top . such a weird cut . there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s"
__label__0 "yes it 's a swing top just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season . i find this silhouette unflattering on me being top heavy so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house . it also runs huge with big gaping arm holes . the sleeves are cute and fluttered . the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer . it is a pretty boxy top which the photo does n't seem to capture . order at least a size smaller than usual ."
__label__-1 "this has such awful proportions . i 'm 5 ' 0 and 100 lbs ordered xxs petite ( in the neutral color ) . the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust ! ! it looks very unflattering and it 's very pronounced . i 'm only 5 ' 0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me . below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it 's sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down . very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi"
__label__0 "first the good : i like the basic shape of the jacket with its crisply cut lapels and rounded corners at the bottom ... the functional pockets ( including the cool watch pocket ) the size of the buttons the color . i got the honey and it was lovely and intense . now the bad : i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short . although it 's a small tight 8 the sleeves are strikingly too long . they would have to be folded and the lining which would show is not that attractive ."
__label__0 "this is a very cute shirt with great details . however it runs a little bit small . not as full cut as it seems ."
__label__0 "this fabric of this top is gorgeous . however i 'm 5 ' 5 and it hits in a really weird spot . right no the point of the hip that you do n't want to accentuate . you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans . sad i love the top 90 % of it ."
__label__0 "wow this runs small ! i 'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs ? ! ?"
__label__1 "i bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect . i got the blue color which is more of a brighter blue than a navy . i 'm 6ft and wear a 10 top but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down . the top was definitely long enough and i did n't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had . this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small"
__label__1 "i want to wear this skirt every day - it 's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it ! can dress it up or down - it 's pretty darn fabulous ! i highly recommend it - you 'll be grateful and feel pretty !"
__label__0 "this is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline . the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide . it 's an odd look ."
__label__-1 "i 'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful . the top is sheer but that 's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse . the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso ( not the chest but the mid-section ) is cut fairly wide . i 'm 5'10 140 # 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit . i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect"
__label__-1 "if you have any cleavage this dress will look awful . the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage . recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look"
__label__0 "... maybe i would 've kept this top . i love the print colors and design . however i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it . since my bust and torso seemed too large for it the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good ."
__label__0 "love these pants . ordered in petite . love style great fit but so long . keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches . decided to order the black & green as well ."
__label__-1 "fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away . however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived . while the cut is cute the fabric is just all wrong . i was expecting a nice heavy knit-like material but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress . sadly it is going back ."
__label__0 "this is such a cute top with so much potential soft fabric vibrant colors and flattering fit on top . however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way . i ordered it in an xxsp so i ca n't even go down in size so this top regrettably has to go back . i love swing tops but retailer could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops ? ?"
__label__0 "the design is cute but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt . also the fabric for the lower part crumples easily . unless you carry around an iron you may not want to wear it outside the house . i kept the shirt to wear around the house ."
__label__1 "this is a heartbreaker ! love this dress 's colors length flow beading and style but its extremely tight in the shoulders and bust . hate to see it go back ...."
__label__0 "this sweater is extremely roomy . the cut is very wide - wider than it is long the sleeves are dolman style and the neck is a little loose . with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i was n't wearing a tent but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin if you can . i 'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i 'm exploring funky town lately . join me at your own risk !"
__label__0 "this cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just did n't seem worth the price . the material is kind of itchy to me and i was n't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front . the colour is very nice and feminine ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes but they are just slightly off . they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down . ( i usually wear a 28 or 29 and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs . ) unfortunately the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray . and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion . i will be returning them ."
__label__1 "this was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on . love it ! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way . colors are great . got the petite size . the pattern is different for each one so each is unique . mine has . lot more navy blue ."
__label__0 "this sweater is very pretty i love the knit and the cream color . for some reason it just did n't flow the way i wanted it to and i did n't love the v neck . just did n't pull me in completely !"
__label__-1 "the neckline is very tight and itchy . the arm holes are deeply cut . the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture . it 's short-waisted . it 's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty ."
__label__-1 "this is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse which i also ordered . it 's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse . it added 20 pounds ! the print is beautiful . the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail . i ordered size large and am well endowed . steer clear if you have a bust ."
__label__-1 "the top fits nice but after one wear ( did n't even washed it ) the fabric was all fuzzy . would not recommend it ."
__label__0 "i am so sad that this romper did n't work out . it 's just way too billowy and huge . i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small . i 'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper ! might look best on taller girls . i am 5 ' 2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent . do not recommend . such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews !"
__label__1 "this blouse has a nice casual feel with feminine lines and the swingy design is flattering ."
__label__-1 "i really loved this skirt on the model but it just was n't flattering when i received my order . i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5 ' 4 athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is . the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to . sadly i had to return both . perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame ."
__label__-1 "i thought this would be a cute business attire skirt . i hate to say it but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children 's book character and not retailer . the fabric made it look bulky . i sadly had to return it ."
__label__0 "bought this in the store and fell in love with it . very soft and flattering to wear . however after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill . this truly is a beautiful sweater but i fear it will not be beautiful for long . i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this coat because like others i was taken by its feminine beauty ! unfortunately the coat showed up with the top button broken off ( and missing ) and another button hole torn open . i returned that coat right away thinking that it 'd been damaged somehow in shipping . however i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button ! when i tried on the coat i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket . not the quality i expe"
__label__0 "i ordered two of these the grey and ivory . i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer . these were the exception . i just could not pull them off . the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy . i do have wider hips . maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin ? for reference i am 5 ' 6 and about 138lbs . i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me the style was just off . i had to return both ."
__label__-1 "ordered this top online as i loved the colors and design but i should have listened to the other reviewers . i ordered my usual size m and it was just very unflattering . it was short and wide not at all like it 's pictured on the model . needless to say it was immediately shipped back ."
__label__0 "beautifully made . beautiful drape . deep blue . so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in . why is it so long ? ? ? ? in 5 ' 6 and got a large . with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls . ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt . may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess"
__label__0 "... for real reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out . i 've had three different ones pop right off ."
__label__1 "this jumper is so cute it is soft and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going ."
__label__0 "this is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured . the band in the back helps hold it together so it does n't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice . i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants ."
__label__0 "i went on a wild goose chase for these jeans as they were sold out all around the country . i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest ! they are my favorite pair of jeans they fit very well . however for the price they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears . i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly . expensive jeans should not sag . i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose even after 20 wears"
__label__-1 "there was nothing i liked about this coat . it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind . the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on . i usually like oranges too but even this color turned me off ."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this top but had 2 major problems with it . first it 's not for short girls . i 'm only 5 ' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise . the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt which was terribly unflattering . second the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking . no regrets on returning this one ."
__label__0 "i love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes ( 32dd 5 ' 3 curvy ) . i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it 's so cute . i could n't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso . such a bummer !"

__label__0 "i have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer and this is not it . like others it 's just so thin and sheer . i live in the south . i do n't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything . this is fine to layer in cooler temps but now in our horrible summers where that 's the last thing i wish to do . - the only plus i can tell you is it 's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin . however"
__label__0 "i loved this dress and ordered it online . i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point . ultimately i decided to return it as i could n't justify spending $ 178 on a dress that did n't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer ."

__label__-1 "i ordered these in m ( 5 ' 8 140 lbs . ) and they are tts : they fit well and are neither tight nor loose . the issue that i have with them ( and the reason that i sent them back ) is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent ; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless ! furthermore these are not white but off-white ( and quite a yellowy off-white at that ) so these loungers do n't look as cute with the feature"

__label__-1 "review title says almost all . add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young . just too cute for words . i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart . this however on an older woman looks ridiculous . i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets !"

__label__1 "i bought this dress for summer celebrations . the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress . the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front . i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket . definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down . very feminine and has a romantic feel ."
__label__-1 "this should have been cute but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering ."

__label__-1 "i 'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress . the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange . for one thing the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse . i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag . also the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length . i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss"
__label__-1 "i was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium boy is it huge the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable even the small would be giant ! for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am . the colours are true and nice and vibrant ... definitely size down with this one"
__label__-1 "really disappointing quality . these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month ! i love pilcros and am totally shocked at the poor quality ... retailer i hope this is just a fluke . not worth the money !"
__label__-1 "after reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out . unfortunately the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot . i like the idea but it 's just not a flattering cut or material . going back !"
__label__0 "i ca n't believe how small these are . i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly . these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them . the rise in the crotch is also very short . very full in the legs and one is longer than the other : ( the stripes do n't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price !"

__label__-1 "love the idea of this top but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap . the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $ 20 at a market abroad . definitely disappointed with the quality for the price . will be retuning ."
__label__0 "tried on this maxi dress recently hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin . so sad : ( . unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much . a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back ."

__label__-1 "i love the fit of these pants -- they 're the perfect slim black pants . however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places . disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and do n't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do . i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product ."
__label__-1 "sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is . i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life . this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style . another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $ 5.00 ! ! !"
__label__-1 "i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite . i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand . this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress . the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame . not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment . i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me . i returned this dress ."

__label__-1 "this dress is just too baggy overall . i am 5 ' 6 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering . i ca n't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me . it was already a little high on the small ."
__label__1 "i purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks . so i purchased the tan jacket . i found it to less tan as an olive color . not my favorite color for me . but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too . the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped . the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse . so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work . recommend . pretty true"
__label__-1 "i bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack . it was quite comfortable and did n't look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering . when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie . i do n't do form-fitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way . it 's got to go back ."
__label__-1 "maybe it 's my curves or the way i 'm only 5 ' 4 but this was a hot mess on me ! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest . it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but ! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather . if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs go for it ! had to send back !"
__label__-1 "i was attracted to the feminine design of the dress the silhouette the flouncy skirt ; however i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy dark colors ."
__label__-1 "this could seriously fit a large and it 's an xs . so frustrating ! ! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous . i get the whole loose fit style but seriously ? ? ? you 've taken it to a whole new level retailer ! ! ! another trip to the store to return another item . a complete waste of my time . ugh ."
__label__0 "snags very very easily . i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged ! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top lovely color and beautifully detailed ! i 'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back ."
__label__1 "this is a very comfortable good-looking skirt . fits as shown . the zipper however is rather short and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips . once on it 's great . it is not made in the usa as stated . it is clearly marked made in mexico from globally sourced materials ( i.e . not from the us ) ."
__label__1 "love the design and colors runs a but large through the middle"
__label__-1 "so disappointed . i love retailer ! this was a huge disappointment . i am 5 ' 3 and 120 pounds . when i put it on all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look . if i was n't so disappointed i might have laughed . this had to have been a design mistake . i 've truly never seen something so unflattering ."
__label__-1 "dear retailer & designers : just want a nice dress that is n't made from polyester ! do n't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics but please- enough of the polyester ! love your customers"
__label__-1 "i might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all . a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small . for me it 's not true at all i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable but it was simply too short ( rather than 20 as it states on the website it 's more like 18 ) which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person ! i do n't even want to go regular size because it would 've been too big . i saw some photos that others po"
__label__-1 "this dress is cuter is person than online but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open . it fell off the minute i tried to undo it . i ca n't believe these other reviewers did n't have the same problem . or maybe they put a snap there instead . too bad ."
__label__-1 "such a great dress . fit is flattering . the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd . classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes . thrilled with purchase !"
__label__1 "i needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine . it is n't as slimming as i had hoped for because it is n't a stretchier denim . but my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit . pants are not easy for me . i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist . quality is good ."
__label__1 "now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done . there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points : great fit flattering silhouette comfortable fabric shape enhancing cut and the easiest casual style ever ! i got the 10p and my body is 5 ' 3 140 # 36dd"
__label__0 "this dress is not what i expected . the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it . the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry . when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms . i would n't of paid full price but for the amount i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter ."
__label__1 "this dress is even better in person . the base color of the fabric is a very light peach and very lovely . as you can see from the photos the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo . the bright green flowers are a light mint green which plays beautifully with the light peach . there are more details in the print to discover in person which is a nice bonus . the silk is not stiff li"
__label__-1 "this dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low . would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return ."
__label__1 "love this shirt . great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather . washes up nice but does need some ironing ."
__label__1 "i have worn this dress twice and it is amazing . the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it . i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it . i am 5 ' 1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly . i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone . definitely one of the best things i 've ever bought from retailer ."
__label__1 "this dress is really beautiful . the material is soft and sways but it is sweater-like not flimsy . it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout but i liked that look . not form-fitting has more of a drape ."
__label__0 "great jeans by pilcro too short and snug around my knees for keeping though ."
__label__-1 "loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding . unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else . it fit well but was poorly made . based off other reviews this is n't the first time this has happened with this dress ! not worth the risk at all ."
__label__1 "i 've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back . this one fits nicely -- just a pretty feminine happy summer top that still lets me be leggy . i ca n't see them in the photos but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots . very fun ! i 'm 5 ' 5 and when i paired this with jean shorts everything below the crotch was visible -- so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics ."
__label__-1 "i bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings . i thought the price was great . too good to be true . you get what you pay for . once i opened the box they smelled awful . it was a chemical smell . i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better . i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells ."
__label__-1 "great hopes but a sorry disappointment . at this price one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model . the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket . i am 5 ' 6 and ordered xxs . garment was significantly over-sized . i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit . because of the oversizing the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo . sadly this buttondown has to be retur"
__label__1 "i saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream . i have worn it every chance i get . it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans . the length is perfect the design is flattering and the material is soft and comfortable . the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse . this will be a go to item . thanks retailer- another gem !"
__label__0 "i am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied . i tend to like things that emphasize my waist however ."
__label__1 "great skirt can be dressy work or casual love it !"
__label__1 "beautiful and very versatile dress . extremely forgiving for post baby bodies while stylish and classy ."
__label__0 "very nice top like the linen fabric . i ordered my regular size m and its huge . makes me look larger than i am and i will be returning it . i would like a size s i think just not a flattering oversize fit for me"
__label__0 "very orange . the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone 's anatomy ... shorter in front and i have a short torso . the fabric is nice and lightweight ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other two reviews . it is so disappointing that this adorable dress is n't lined . the fabric is paper thin ! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy . i sized down to a petite xs . i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it . i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size ."
__label__-1 "i was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up . the waist does not have elastic or any structure . the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open . the fabric is nice quality but i am returning ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to order this dress had the perfect red shoes to go with it . unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small . i am 5 ' 4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress . sad to send it back ."
__label__0 "beautiful . got several compliments when wearing it . does not hold up with washes though . threads unraveling everywhere . i am thinking of returning it for this reason . fits true to size . i am 5 ' 4 118 lbs xs fit . i am smaller on top ."

__label__-1 "after reading the previous review i was pretty confident in ordering this dress . it arrived in the mail today and i was so disappointed . first of all it 's huge . the medium was way too big on me and i 'm never a small at retailer ! ( i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer . ) second the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo and the fabric felt cheap . finally it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that did n't fit right ."
__label__1 "it is a beautiful dress light and delicate . i got my usual xsmall ( 5 ' 4 34c 134 lbs ) . it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted . it worked for me but i can see this being an issue . it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip . it is worth it . very cute dress ."
__label__-1 "i generally do n't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale . who can wear these ? i 'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips buttoned and zipped . i looked like a stuffed black sausage . best for thin frames and even then size up ."
__label__1 "i love the dress overall however found it a tad snug in the bust area . overall a beautiful dress to own ."
__label__-1 "this is a great cut and looks good on . it is a very poor quality material . it balled and frayed in two wears . i returned it to the store ."
__label__-1 "i love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite . unfortunately the fabric was stiff it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there . returned ."
__label__0 "the idea of this dress is lovely . the fabric is pleasing to the touch . the print manages to be eye catching but understated . i do n't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing . i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance . i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly . the top fits poorly . i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders . how"
__label__0 "i just sent this back . it is very cute & the fabric is great so soft & comfy but it does n't work with my shape . it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you do n't have a large chest . on me it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it . am a 34dd . it 's not the fault of the top but a bigger size would have swallowed me . i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model this will be adorable on you . i am just too busty ."
__label__1 "this dress is perfect for the summer very lightweight has pockets and not to short lounging around . it is loose fitting so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5 ' 6 tall but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly ."
__label__0 "this is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting . i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i do n't need to show but if you 're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear this would be super cute ."
__label__0 "the concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric . i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame . although i appreciate the design it did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "this top is really beautiful but looks absolutely horrible on my 5 ' 9 apple shaped body . in the words of my husband i looked like a star trek villain ."
__label__-1 "i love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great . this dress does not meet those standards . on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke . i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress i 'm dissapointed ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy . it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear . the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions . it was n't as elegant as the model pic ( is it ever ? ) and for this price should fit like a glove . went back within seconds . also it 's pretty short and bulky short is n't flattering on too many people ."
__label__0 "love the style and fit but it does stretch out during wear . by the end of the day it feels big ."
__label__-1 "do n't be fooled by the photos online . the color is a bright baby blue not pale blue . it 's a beautifully designed dress however the material is so bulky and heavy . it 's so unflattering . i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true : this dress just hung on me and pulled me down . i wanted so much to love it but i returned it ."
__label__-1 "i can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces so when i saw this sweatshirt online i ordered it right away . it & # 39 ; s adorable and quirky however when i received it in the mail it reminded me of something my grandma would wear . the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing . if this was a more tailored sweatshirt i would be keeping it but sadly it & # 39 ; s going back ."
__label__-1 "i absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black . wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect ! very comfortable easy to throw on and dress up or down . i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning ( as i usually do ) and after hanging dry it became significantly more translucent than it had been before ! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it . it 's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet ."
__label__1 "i am pleased with this skirt . the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips . i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse . i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater ! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase ! it 's even cuter on ! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look . perfect weight for summer !"
__label__-1 "pretty shirt on the hanger but there 's a goof in the design . when i tried it on my 3d self there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo now that i know it 's there . the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it 's not flattering and i 'm just a 34 b ."
__label__-1 "in a sea of dresses this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store . i am a pear shape and ended up trying both the medium and the large taking the medium home . it was super flattering on and was an appropriate length to pair with tights . here 's where the problem happened . i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving i put it on and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip ! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband . so disappointed ."
__label__-1 "this dress is just very unattractive . it is quite short-waisted almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place . also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide . the effect is matronly not cute at all . size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good ."
__label__0 "this dress was so lovely in person but when i put it on ... ooh la la ! it is short ! i am 5 ' 3 and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath . it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure . too bad !"
__label__0 "i had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit . i 'm normally a 10-12 preferably a petite . i ordered this in a large and i could n't begin to zip it up . it also ran extremely short in the crotch area . very pretty print but it 's going back !"
__label__0 "i bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner . the dress it 's self is beautiful good quality and a perfect summer maxi . however it was way too big . i 'm 5 ' 6 118 lbs i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric . i loved the style and make of the dress so i choose to get it tailored ."
__label__1 "love this sweatshirt ! i 'm 5 ' 2 110lbs and ordered the x-small . it 's a little boxy but very comfy . it 's definitely light peach in color and not pink as shown . very happy with this purchase !"
__label__1 "i love this sweater especially the color . i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange . the fit was perfect . i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings ."
__label__0 "this dress is very good quality with beautiful beading on the bodice . it 's a heavier material than i was expecting but that was a pleasant surprise . unfortunately when i put it on and looked in the mirror i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid . the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and combined with the overall design and length i could n't think of anywhere to wear it . this is an easy return for me . the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit"
__label__1 "this top was very pretty when i got it but i was hoping it would be a bit longer . the v neck design was nice and the fabric very soft . i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine ."
__label__1 "i 'm glad i listened to the other reviewers ... i ordered a large instead of my usual medium . it 's roomy enough for a sweater underneath . i love the denim ! it 's very soft and has some stretch . my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing . i also love the darker denim ."
__label__1 "these have been a staple for me the last three years . i have owned three pairs of them in black . i have n't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life ! ! ! please please bring them back ! !"
__label__-1 "got this in purple and love it ! ordered red and silver and only received red so far but had to return because it was oddly shaped and did n't fit well like the purple . not sure what happens . maybe miss sized ?"
__label__1 "if you happen to get a size that fits you you will love these leggings . they are true to size when the quality control works . i got 2 pair both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans ! the material is very soft and comfortable . also not sure who named these colors but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple ."
__label__1 "love this sweater ! it is so cozy ! i gave it a four because it does shed a lot . i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding . i am hoping to buy other colors ."
__label__0 "i purchased the grey in a medium i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops 36 c .. i found it to fit quite well but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy . so if you have a longer torso ( like me ) you may not be the happiest . i loved the lace and did n't have an issue with that area being sheer but the non-lace part is very thin . i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around you could even see the width of th"

__label__0 "it 's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house . it 's comfy and i like the detail of the back . the front is very plain but okay . it 's not too baggy and it 's a straight cut . the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store ."
__label__0 "overall : soft material cute pattern - but definitely a return as just did n't fit right . fit : i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small . it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle . i 've lost a bit of weight recently - so i 'm more of a 36a than 36b these days - but this would n't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad"
__label__-1 "it is soft and hangs great . problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible . it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time . would n't recommend . though it is sooooo soft !"
__label__0 "the problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem . ."
__label__0 "this shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material it was not worth the $ 68 . the colors offered were a little drab . i thought the grey could work for me but it did n't . the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $ 68 shirt- the roll does n't lay flat all the way around . would be better priced in the $ 30- $ 40 range ."
__label__0 "i think these are amazing for anyone over say 5 ' 5 . the way these hung on me ( at 5 ' 2 ) were very unflattering in the front . they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them . that 's all i can say without being crass ."
__label__0 "i love this dress the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled ! once i washed it ( yes its washable ) it looked fantastic ! ! !"
__label__1 "i love a good gaucho/ culotte . these are very comfortable and fit is tts ( i 'm 5 ' 9 145 and wear a 29 ) . they are ironed with a line down the front which i do n't like as it 's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight . the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice . since they 're linen they will require frequent ironing ( which i hate to do in the summer ) ."
__label__1 "i saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute but not really enough to spend the money on . i purchased a few other things instead . i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one . it is definitely cuter in person . as with most tops like this it is baggy and loose . however probably due to the elastic at the bottom this one does n't look overly big and shapeless . just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring . for reference i am 5 ' 6 115 a"
__label__1 "i have three pairs of these in different colors ( one pair is striped ) and i love them . they are flattering and comfy . they go with nearly everything . ca n't get enough ! ! ! ! !"
__label__0 "i like the quality of material of this top but it 's too long and wide for my frame . the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders . too bad as i really wanted to love this ."
__label__1 "i really liked the beautiful fabric design and length of the piece ."
__label__1 "best part : covers my bum . perfect for teaching casual girls ' night or casual date night . my only complaint is there are n't other colors . awful decision . i would have purchased at least 5 of these at the right price ."
__label__0 "i bought the orange color . i had a hard time styling it as it is so long . since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve you 'll need a jacket or sweater on top . nothing looked right . it has a relatively high and tight neck so sweaters looked weird . short jackets did n't work either . i 'm 5 ' 4 and bought the small . returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
__label__1 "fits great comfortable !"
__label__-1 "i love this top ( so cute and comfy ! ) but i wore it twice washed it once on gentle and layed to dry ..... now there are 2 small holes in the front . for as much as it cost i would have expected it to be more durable . very disappointing especially since i do n't live near an retailer and ca n't take it back easily ......"
__label__-1 "i was so bummed by this dress ! i had high hopes when i ordered it but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived . the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of . i found the fit baggy and unflattering . the shawl portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders very disappointed . i already returned this ."
__label__1 "this is the perfect holiday dress . my best purchase of the season !"
__label__1 "really cute tee ... charcoal is deep and great all seasons . cut high on sides ... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape . tried the white did n't buy -- - too lightweight but could work layered ."
__label__1 "this great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket . it has a roomy comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist . got lots of compliments on the embroidery ."
__label__0 "first i absolutely love this dress and i was super excited when it arrived today . i sized up as other reviewers recommended and the dress fits perfectly . however when i zipped the dress up the zipper came apart in the center . going up another size would make the dress fit improperly so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful and warm sweater well cut and easy to dress up or down . the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing especially against wool or cashmere winter coats ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very 80 's ! ! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors but in person it 's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80 's colors ! ! if you 're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you 'll be disappointed ... : ( it looked to be true to size but to be honest i hated it so much i did n't even try it on ."
__label__1 "i was n't sure how to rate the fit on these . i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there 's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area . i tried a 10 but the waist did n't fit . i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print . there is no stretch in these either . i have slim legs- if you do n't i would size up or just pass . the calf is tight ."
__label__-1 "completely oversized top size medium was swimming on me ..... boxy baggy shapeless -- what more can i say ? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo returned ."
__label__1 "got these in my usual size and they are wonderful ! the gray goes with everything i 'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too !"

__label__-1 "i do n't know who this would fit . looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack ! i think the knit must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms !"

__label__0 "i carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles . the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice . the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra . the colors are deeper than shown . but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top . i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it 's just not my style . better suited i think for taller slimmer bod"

__label__1 "i finally tried this on now that it went on sale and it was surprisingly flattereing . love the blue color and i assume the purple was equally nice . fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great long but ok for me"
__label__-1 "it 's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me ."
__label__1 "beautiful top and beautiful bright color . this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area . i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short . if you get the right size this topics really adorable . my husband also gave it a big thumbs up ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love these sleep pants . they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun . i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they did n't fade or shrink . grab a pair while you still can you wo n't regret it ."
__label__0 "i loved this sweater when i bought it . wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag . it shrunk at least two sizes ! and the tassels got all tangled ( which i guess i should have seen coming ) . pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on ."
__label__0 "beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality . i hand washed ( per the instructions ) it after wearing it once and the sleeves are already falling apart ."
__label__-1 "i own 4-5 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material . this one missed the mark . not soft and very thick . not what i was expecting ."
__label__1 "i just bought this top in size medium and i love it . super comfortable and flowy . if you want to dry it in the machine just put cold air and it wo n't shrink . do n't use hot air ..."
__label__0 "these are a great casual pants with a lot of style . my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs . i purchased a 29 in store which fit i then ordered another 29 online which did not fit there is at least an inch difference please see photos . i then ordered a 30 online to see if that would be better and there 's over 2 inches of difference within the same size run of the 30s . who is making these pants ? ca n't they get the pants to be the same size within the sa"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress but sadly i will be returning . the color looked fairly different in person than on the model . i thought it was a browner/neutral hue but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing . was cuter than expected ! the sweetheart neckline is darling but that is where it fit me poorly . i have a 34c bust and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes . the straps were also way too long and falling off my"
__label__-1 "i had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself . i was very excited to get it as it is a beautiful coat online . however once i received it i was very disappointed . the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $ 168 and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with . i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well . perso"
__label__-1 "i agree with the other review . the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made . the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality ; however the shirt is very wide . i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big . the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance ."
__label__1 "in love with this blouse i first got in ivory went back and got in black you can dress casual or up ."
__label__0 "i like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too . gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front . you will look prettier coming than going for sure !"

__label__1 "i wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits ! it 's is versatile and figure flattering . i only buy timeless pieces that i know wo n't go out of style and this vest fits the bill !"
__label__0 "i love this dress . the design is gorgeous . however the bust is extremely small . only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size . i am disappointed ."
